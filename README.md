# Flipkart Affiliate Override

Affiliate overriding for Flipkart

# Uses

* Overrides the affiliate parameter to your own.
* You can distribute this extension to your friends and ask them to use your affiliate account while shopping.
* It also adds a QR code to the product page so you can use the mobile app to make purchases (the commission is generally higher on the app)

# Aim
The final aim is to have this enabled for all popular shopping websites.

# Ethics
This steals the commissions from deal sites. So whenever you click a link from any deal site, it overrides it to your own and takes away their share of the commission. You can turn this off if you feel this is unethical.
